### Introduction

In today's digital age, public institutions are rapidly embracing open data management to foster data accessibility and transparency. The London Borough of Hounslow recognized this need and transformed its approach by migrating from a self-hosted CKAN solution to **PortalJS Cloud—the easiest open data portal solution that allows you to build your portal in 5 minutes**.

### Background

The London Borough of Hounslow, a prominent local authority in West London, has long recognized the importance of open data for transparency, civic engagement, and data-driven decision-making. To fulfill these goals, the Borough initially deployed its open data platform using a self-hosted and self-managed CKAN solution on its internal AWS infrastructure. While this approach granted full control over its environment, it also introduced complexity, maintenance overhead, and cost concerns.

### Challenges with the Previous Setup

Running a self-hosted CKAN instance in the Borough’s AWS tenant involved multiple cloud services and a dedicated team to manage them. Key challenges included:

- **High Maintenance Overhead**: The CKAN ecosystem requires attentive administration. From monitoring Postgres databases and Solr indexes to managing the Python-based application layers and S3 object storage, maintaining system health and security demanded significant time and specialized expertise.

- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Ensuring reliable networking and scaling EC2 instances for stable, production-grade deployments became a persistent operational burden. This complexity limited the team’s capacity to focus on more strategic, value-added activities related to data curation and community engagement.

- **Escalating Cloud Costs**: Operating costs ballooned as the Borough’s data ambitions grew. AWS usage fees for EC2, RDS (Postgres), and storage, coupled with ongoing labor expenses, contributed to a hefty annual bill that was difficult to justify at scale.

### The Move to PortalJS Cloud

Seeking a more streamlined and cost-effective approach, the London Borough of Hounslow partnered with Datopian to migrate its open data portal to PortalJS Cloud. The Borough’s new site, now live at [https://data.hounslow.gov.uk/](https://data.hounslow.gov.uk), represents a modern, fully managed, and more sustainable solution for delivering open data services. **PortalJS Cloud** not only simplifies maintenance but also enables organizations to **build their portal in 5 minutes**—making it the easiest open data portal solution available.

### Key Benefits

1. **Zero Infrastructure Headaches**:
   With PortalJS Cloud, the entire technology stack—from back-end databases and indexing services to front-end features—is fully managed by the PortalJS team. The Borough’s data and IT specialists no longer need to perform routine updates, patch security vulnerabilities, or worry about network configurations. Instead, they can concentrate on data quality, policy development, and stakeholder engagement.

2. **Significant Cost Savings**:
   Migrating away from a self-managed AWS environment to PortalJS Cloud has resulted in remarkable AWS cost savings. The streamlined model reduces both cloud expenses and internal staffing costs. Instead of provisioning and paying for EC2 instances, Postgres via RDS, and a variety of other services, the Borough now benefits from an integrated, pay-as-you-go platform. This leaner model not only slashes monthly cloud bills but also frees full-time employee (FTE) time, leading to major efficiency gains.


3. **Professional Onboarding and Customization**:
   Beyond technology management, the PortalJS Cloud team provided seamless onboarding support and assisted in tailoring the portal’s UI/UX to align with the London Borough of Hounslow’s branding and design guidelines. This attention to detail ensures that the open data portal not only performs reliably but also resonates visually with its intended audience, thereby enhancing user trust and engagement.

4. **Future-Proof Scalability**:
   As the Borough’s open data needs evolve, PortalJS Cloud can effortlessly scale to meet new demands. Whether it’s adding more datasets, enhancing data visualization capabilities, or accommodating increased traffic from citizens and researchers, the platform grows in tandem with the Borough’s ambitions—no costly re-architecting or major downtime required.

### Impact and Results

The London Borough of Hounslow’s move to PortalJS Cloud has fundamentally transformed its open data operations. The platform’s robust, managed environment has eliminated the complexity of overseeing a dynamic CKAN ecosystem internally, cut operational expenses, and accelerated the Borough’s ability to serve its community through open data. Freed from day-to-day platform upkeep, Hounslow’s team can now devote their energy to developing innovative data strategies and fostering a more transparent, data-driven environment for residents and local businesses.

### Conclusion

For the London Borough of Hounslow, PortalJS Cloud delivered a powerful trifecta of benefits. This fully managed solution has dramatically **reduced operational complexity**, delivered substantial **AWS cost savings**, and empowered the Borough with a tailored open data portal that can be built in just 5 minutes.

## Context

The [**Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MOEI**)](https://www.moei.gov.ae/) **of the UAE** plays a pivotal role in managing and developing key national sectors, including **energy, mining, water resources, land and sea transportation, roads, utilities, housing, and construction**. As part of its strategic plan, the ministry aims to enhance **sectoral competitiveness, sustainability, and investment efficiency** by leveraging **technology, partnerships, and advanced sciences**.

Aligned with the [**UAE Centennial 2071 vision**](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/strategies-initiatives-and-awards/strategies-plans-and-visions/innovation-and-future-shaping/uae-centennial-2071), MOEI's roadmap focuses on **digital transformation, data-driven decision-making, and service excellence**. The goal is to strengthen the **national economy, improve infrastructure resilience, and ensure high-quality public services** built on principles of** efficiency, transparency, and global best practices**.

To support **government transparency and public access to critical datasets**, MOEI needed an **open data portal** that would centralize and streamline dataset management while ensuring **bilingual accessibility, seamless user experience, and developer-friendly integration**.

MOEI sought Datopian’s expertise to design, build, and maintain a **comprehensive open data platform** that aligns with the UAE’s **vision for a data-powered future**.

## The Situation

MOEI recognized the need for a **modern open data portal** after seeing Datopian’s work on the [**Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre (FCSC) Open Data Portal**](https://www.datopian.com/showcase/case-studies/revolutionizing-open-data-fcsc). The ministry wanted a **similar, but customized solution** to efficiently publish, manage, and maintain **high-value datasets**.

They already had a **Microsoft Azure-based infrastructure**, used to host their [main ministry website](https://moei.gov.ae/), making it essential that the **open data platform integrate smoothly within their existing ecosystem**.

Challenges MOEI faced before the project:

- No centralized repository for publishing and managing open datasets.
- Limited accessibility for **bilingual users (Arabic and English)**.
- Lack of **structured metadata and categorization**, making data discovery inefficient.
- No self-service options for users to request or provide feedback on datasets.
- Limited engagement tools to encourage **public and developer participation**.
- No interactive **visualization tools** to make datasets more useful to researchers, businesses, and policymakers.

MOEI needed a **scalable, intuitive, and self-sufficient** data portal that would serve as a **key digital asset** for UAE’s open government data strategy.

## The Criteria

Datopian was commissioned to design and develop an open data portal that would:

- Support Arabic and English, ensuring full right-to-left (RTL) functionality for Arabic.
- Feature a modern, clean UI aligned with the existing MOEI website design.
- Provide topic-based dataset organization to improve discoverability.
- Offer advanced search and filtering options for users to quickly find relevant datasets.
- Include API-first architecture, ensuring easy integration with government services, smart city initiatives, and research institutions.
- Ensure compliance with accessibility standards, making data available to all users.
- Allow users to request new datasets and submit feedback.
- Include a chart builder to let users generate custom visualizations directly from dataset resources.
- Offer dataset preview, download, sharing, and citation functionalities.
- Enable capacity building so that MOEI’s internal team could maintain and expand the portal independently.


## The Solution

### UI/UX Design

To ensure a **consistent and intuitive experience**, we designed the **MOEI Open Data Portal** to align with the **aesthetic and functional principles** of the ministry’s existing website.

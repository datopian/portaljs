title: A Global Transport Hub
metatitle: TDC Open Data Portal Built with CKAN and PortalJS | Datopian
metaDescription: See how TDC used CKAN and PortalJS to launch a global open data portal—automating ingestion, standardizing SDMX metadata, and improving data access.
description: We helped the Transport Data Commons (TDC) transform fragmented transport and sustainability data into a unified, public-facing portal. Using CKAN and PortalJS, we built a user-friendly platform that standardizes metadata, automates data ingestion, and enables seamless access and collaboration across 30+ global organizations.

keystats:
  [
    '30+ organizations/n sharing one shared portal',
    '100% custom frontend/n built entirely with PortalJS',
    '80% less manual work/n through automation and workflows',
  ]
problem:
  'Transport and sustainability data was scattered across disconnected systems—PDFs, spreadsheets, and portals with limited structure. There was no unified place to find consistent, high-quality datasets. Without shared metadata standards or clear contribution processes, organizations struggled to collaborate, often duplicating work. Analysts spent more time cleaning data than analyzing it.'
solution:
  'Datopian delivered a unified open data platform using CKAN for the backend and PortalJS for the frontend. We replaced the default UI with a custom, fully decoupled interface tailored to non-technical users. The platform includes automated data ingestion pipelines, SDMX-compliant metadata, rich search and filter tools, onboarding flows, and role-based publishing workflows—making data management and access faster, simpler, and more reliable.'
results:
  'TDC now operates a centralized, public data portal where 30+ organizations can contribute, manage, and explore datasets efficiently. The platform enables faster decision-making, reduces duplication, and supports international collaboration. Contributors follow structured publishing flows; users benefit from intuitive discovery tools. By standardizing data and simplifying workflows, the portal turns fragmented inputs into a shared, trusted resource.'
features:
  [
    ' - **Built for multi-organization publishing** – PortalJS is ideal for coalitions like TDC — enabling role-based access, contributor dashboards, and streamlined publishing across 30+ organizations.',
    'hexagonal',
    ' - **Supports structured metadata like SDMX** – TDC needed metadata aligned with SDMX standards. PortalJS made it easy to surface, search, and display structured datasets clearly.',
    'presentation-1',
    ' - **Turned disconnected data into a unified platform** – From scattered PDFs to a live, searchable portal — PortalJS helped TDC centralize transport and sustainability data in one public space.',
    'rocket',
    ' - **Frontend flexibility without backend changes** – All workflows — including dataset approval, visibility toggling, and publishing flows — were built on the frontend with no backend rewrites.',
    'repair-tools',
    ' - **Visual exploration through filters and maps** - Users can search by region, sector, or keyword — or use an interactive map to explore country-specific datasets.',
    'magnify',
    ' - **Custom contributor onboarding flow** - We built a guided onboarding experience tailored to TDC: helping users follow topics, join organizations, and start contributing with confidence.',

What if the key to smarter, more transparent governance wasnâ€™t spending moreâ€”but spending less? Too often, data portals are seen as unavoidable financial burdens, rather than an opportunity. But they donâ€™t have to be. Your data portal can be a cornerstone of transparency, innovation, and better decision-making without draining your budget.

Proprietary solutions, while promising the world, often deliver a painful bill. Hidden fees, rigid systems, and vendor lock-in quietly inflate costs while limiting your ability to adapt. And for what? A tool thatâ€™s supposed to serve your organization ends up as a line item thatâ€™s tough to justify.

But what if it didnâ€™t have to be this way? What if you could cut your data portal expenses by 90%â€”or moreâ€”every year **without compromising on performance, compliance, or scalability**? Itâ€™s not just a possibility; itâ€™s a practical reality. Letâ€™s break down where your money is going, and how a smarter approach can turn your data portal from a financial burden into a strategic asset.

## Where Do the Costs Come From?

If youâ€™ve ever stared at a bloated invoice from a data portal vendor, youâ€™ve probably wondered: Where is all this money going? Hereâ€™s what youâ€™re often paying for:

1. **Licensing Fees**: Proprietary solutions can charge six or even seven figures annually. And guess what? Those fees only grow as your data needs increase.

2. **Customization Costs**: Need your portal to match your organizationâ€™s branding or workflows? Many platforms charge extra for every tweak.

3. **Maintenance & Hosting**: Whether itâ€™s managing servers, ensuring uptime, or resolving bugs, these costs add up fast.

4. **Training & Support**: Onboarding your team often comes at an additional cost, and premium support packages can be staggeringly expensive.

When you add it all up, itâ€™s no wonder small towns, mid-sized cities, and even large governments struggle to justify the expense. But it doesnâ€™t have to be this way.

## The Open Source Alternative: Why CKAN Is the Gold Standard

CKAN, the open-source data portal solution has become the gold standard for governments, NGOs, and research institutions. Unlike proprietary systems, CKAN is free to use, infinitely customizable, and backed by a global community of developers. Butâ€”and this is a big oneâ€”while CKAN saves you licensing fees, it doesnâ€™t eliminate all costs. You still need hosting, maintenance, and a user-friendly frontend to make it work for your audience.

Thatâ€™s where solutions like **PortalJS Cloud** come into play. By combining CKANâ€™s power with modern, fully managed hosting and customizable frontends, you get the best of both worlds: open-source affordability and enterprise-grade performance.

## How PortalJS Cloud Helps You Save

Letâ€™s break down exactly how PortalJS Cloud can help you trim 90% (or more) from your annual data portal expenses.

1. No Licensing Fees
Most proprietary platforms lock you into expensive annual contracts. PortalJS Cloud? None of that. Since itâ€™s built on CKAN, youâ€™re free from those hefty licensing costs. Youâ€™re essentially only paying for the hosting and support you needâ€”not for the privilege of using the platform.

2. Streamlined Maintenance & Hosting
Maintaining your own CKAN instance can be time-consuming and expensive, especially if youâ€™re not a tech-heavy organization. PortalJS Cloud offers fully managed hosting, which means we handle the backend, updates, and troubleshooting for you. Thatâ€™s one less thing for your IT team to worry about (or for you to outsource).

3. Scalable Pricing
Instead of a one-size-fits-all model, PortalJS Cloud scales to meet your needs. For small towns with limited budgets, plans start at just $99/month. Larger governments can choose plans with advanced features while still saving massively compared to proprietary options.

4. Customizable Frontend Without Extra Fees
Proprietary platforms often charge an arm and a leg for customization. PortalJS Cloud lets you tailor your data portalâ€™s design and functionality without breaking the bank. Want your portal to reflect your cityâ€™s branding? Done. Need specific features for public-facing users? No problem.

5. Faster Deployment, Lower Costs
Some systems take months to set up, driving up costs with each passing day. PortalJS Cloud offers 5-minute deployment for basic configurations, so you can start sharing data (and seeing value) almost immediately.

Whether itâ€™s improving data accessibility, expanding transparency efforts, or aligning your data strategy with your long-term goals, the shift to a smarter, more flexible solution creates space for meaningful progress.

## More Than Savings: Future-Proofing Your Data Portal

Itâ€™s not just about saving money. Itâ€™s about investing in a system that grows with you. PortalJS Cloud combines CKANâ€™s open-source foundation with modern architecture, ensuring your portal is scalable, adaptable, and built to last.

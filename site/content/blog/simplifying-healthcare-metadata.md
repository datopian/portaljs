# Simplifying Healthcare Metadata
**A Simple Frontend for Sensitive Healthcare Datasets**
Discover how we helped a UK public health data provider build a user-friendly interface over OpenMetadata. Researchers got a fast, searchable portal for discovering datasets ‚Äî without needing to learn a new system. A lightweight PortalJS frontend, fully integrated with Azure and OpenMetadata, transformed usability while keeping backend infrastructure intact.

### Quick Stats

| 100% Secure | 300+ Datasets | 60% Fewer Tickets |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Entra ID login, Azure-hosted | searchable via PortalJS | metadata-related support requests down |

## The Problem  
**Sensitive healthcare data was locked behind technical barriers**  

- **Hidden Catalog** ‚Äì Researchers couldn‚Äôt view or search the full dataset inventory across virtual machines.  
- **Fragmented Access** ‚Äì Each user only saw a limited slice of the data, causing duplicated work and missed insights.  
- **Technical Interfaces** ‚Äì OpenMetadata‚Äôs UI was built for engineers, not clinicians or public health researchers ‚Äî resulting in friction and delays.

## The Solution  
**A user-friendly PortalJS frontend over OpenMetadata**  

- **PortalJS Interface** ‚Äì A lightweight, intuitive frontend tailored for non-technical researchers to explore and request data.  
- **OpenMetadata Backbone** ‚Äì Metadata, access control, and governance handled via robust backend APIs ‚Äî invisible to end users.  
- **Smart Features** ‚Äì Secure login with Microsoft Entra ID, built-in glossary, dataset Q&A, and one-click publishing to virtual workspaces.

## The Impact  
**Healthcare research workflows ‚Äî simplified and accelerated**

- **Unified Discovery** ‚Äì Researchers can now search and filter across the full dataset catalog with ease.  
- **Human-Centric UX** ‚Äì Q&A threads and glossary terms reduce confusion and support tickets.  
- **Operational Boost** ‚Äì Faster dataset provisioning, better data reuse, and less friction in onboarding new researchers.

## Comparing What Was vs. What Is
By combining OpenMetadata with PortalJS, we preserved robust data governance and observability while layering on a fast, intuitive frontend. OpenMetadata handles the metadata, access control, and backend integration. PortalJS transforms that into a clean, searchable interface designed for real human use.

|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Dataset Discovery        | Fragmented, invisible across workspaces    | Unified catalog, searchable and filterable |
| Non-tech User Experience | Complex, engineer-focused                  | Simple, human-first UI                     |
| Dataset Q&A              | Manual via email or ticketing              | Built-in threaded discussions              |
| Dataset Updates          | Hard to communicate changes                | Inline publication notes from stewards     |
| Workspace Provisioning   | Manual coordination                        | One-click ‚ÄúAdd to Workspace‚Äù action        |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does this replace OpenMetadata?**  
No ‚Äî it extends it. PortalJS acts as a frontend layer while OpenMetadata remains the backend.

**Is this secure enough for healthcare data?**  
Yes. All access is governed via Microsoft Entra ID. No data is exposed unless authorized.

**Can I deploy this on my own infrastructure?**  
Absolutely. The solution is delivered as a Docker container and works seamlessly with Azure-based environments.

**What if I‚Äôm not in healthcare?**  
No problem ‚Äî PortalJS works across sectors: government, energy, finance, climate, and more.

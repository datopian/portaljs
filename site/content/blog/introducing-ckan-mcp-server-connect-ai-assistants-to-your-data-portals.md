## Introduction

The world of AI assistants is rapidly evolving, but there's been a persistent challenge: how do we connect these powerful tools to the vast repositories of data that organizations maintain? Enter the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Anthropic's groundbreaking open standard that's revolutionizing how AI systems interact with data sources.

Today, we're excited to introduce the **CKAN MCP Server**, a specialized implementation that bridges AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and others directly to your CKAN data portals. This isn't just another integration - it's a fundamental shift in how we think about AI-powered data discovery and interaction.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

Before diving into our CKAN implementation, let's understand what makes MCP so revolutionary. Announced by Anthropic in November 2024, the Model Context Protocol is quickly becoming the universal standard for connecting AI assistants to data systems.

### The Problem MCP Solves

Traditional AI assistants are "trapped behind information silos and legacy systems." Every new data source requires custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale. Until now, connecting an AI assistant to your organization's data meant:

- Building custom integrations for each data source
- Managing fragmented, bespoke connections
- Dealing with security and access control complexities
- Maintaining multiple different protocols and standards

### The MCP Solution

MCP replaces these fragmented integrations with a single, open protocol. Think of it as the "USB standard" for AI-data connections - any MCP-compliant data source can serve context to any MCP-enabled AI client, and vice versa.

## Industry Adoption: The New Standard for AI

The adoption of MCP has been remarkable. Major tech companies are rapidly integrating it:

- **OpenAI** officially adopted MCP in March 2025, integrating it across ChatGPT, their Agents SDK, and Responses API
- **Google DeepMind** announced MCP support in Gemini models, with CEO Demis Hassabis calling it "rapidly becoming an open standard for the AI agentic era"
- **Microsoft** unveiled plans to make MCP a "foundational layer for secure, interoperable agentic computing" in Windows 11

By early 2025, the community had already created over 1,000 MCP servers, covering everything from GitHub and Slack to databases and enterprise systems.

## Introducing the CKAN MCP Server

### What is CKAN?

CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) is the world's leading open-source data management system, used by governments, research institutions, and organizations worldwide to publish, share, and manage datasets. From national open data portals to research repositories, CKAN powers some of the most important data infrastructure on the web.

### Why Connect CKAN to AI Assistants?

Imagine being able to:

- **Ask natural language questions** about datasets: "Show me environmental datasets from 2020"
- **Get instant summaries** of complex data without browsing through catalogs
- **Discover relationships** between datasets across different organizations
- **Access metadata** and resources through conversational interfaces
- **Integrate data discovery** into your existing AI workflows

This is exactly what the CKAN MCP Server enables.

## How It Works: Technical Overview

### Architecture

![MCP Server Architecture Diagram](/static/img/blog/introducing-ckan-mcp-server-connect-ai-assistants-to-your-data-portals/mcp-server-diagram.png)

The CKAN MCP Server acts as a bridge between MCP-compatible AI clients and CKAN APIs. Here's the flow:

1. **AI Assistant** sends a request through MCP protocol
2. **CKAN MCP Server** translates the request to CKAN API calls
3. **CKAN Portal** returns data and metadata
4. **Server processes and formats** the response for the AI
5. **AI Assistant** receives structured data to provide intelligent responses

### Available Tools

The server currently provides these MCP tools:

- **`search_datasets`**: Search for datasets using natural language queries
- **`get_dataset`**: Retrieve detailed information about specific datasets
- **`list_organizations`**: Browse organizations and their data offerings

## Deployment Options: Flexible and Scalable

### Local Development
Perfect for testing and development:

```bash
# Quick start with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Configure in your AI client
"ckan": {
  "command": "docker",
  "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--env-file", ".env", "ckan-mcp-server:latest"]
}
```

### Production Deployment
For organizations ready to scale:

```bash
# HTTPS deployment with SSL
docker-compose -f docker-compose.http.yml up -d

# Your MCP server is available at:
# https://your-domain.com/mcp
```

The server supports both **stdio transport** (for local development) and **HTTP/HTTPS transport** (for production deployments), making it suitable for everything from individual experimentation to enterprise-scale implementations.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Examples in Action

#### Searching for Datasets

### Government Open Data
Government agencies can enable citizens and researchers to interact with public datasets using natural language. Instead of navigating complex data portals, users can simply ask: "What environmental data is available for my city?"

### Research Institutions
Researchers can quickly discover relevant datasets across multiple repositories, understand data provenance, and identify potential collaborations through AI-powered data exploration.

### Enterprise Data Discovery
Organizations can connect their internal CKAN instances to AI assistants, enabling employees to find and understand corporate data assets without specialized knowledge of data catalogs.

### Data Journalism
Journalists can rapidly identify story-relevant datasets, understand their context, and explore connections between different data sources through conversational interfaces.

## Getting Started: Your Journey to AI-Powered Data Discovery

### Prerequisites
- A CKAN instance (can be demo.ckan.org for testing)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- An MCP-compatible AI client (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

### Step 1: Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/datopian/ckan-mcp-server.git
cd ckan-mcp-server
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env with your CKAN configuration
```

### Step 2: Configuration
```env
CKAN_INSTANCE_URL=https://api.cloud.portaljs.com/
CKAN_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
PORT=8000
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
# Local development
docker-compose up -d

# Or production with HTTPS
docker-compose -f docker-compose.http.yml up -d
```

### Step 4: Connect Your AI Client
Add the MCP server to your AI assistant's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ckan": {
      "url": "https://your-domain.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## The Future of AI-Powered Data Discovery

The CKAN MCP Server represents more than just a technical integration - it's a glimpse into the future of how we'll interact with data. As MCP becomes the standard protocol for AI-data connections, we're moving toward a world where:

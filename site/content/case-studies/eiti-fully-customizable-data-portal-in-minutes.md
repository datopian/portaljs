### Introduction

[The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)](https://eiti.org/) plays a crucial role in promoting transparency and accountability in the global extractive sectors. As an international standard-setter and watchdog for publicly accessible information, EITI needed a robust, flexible, and user-friendly digital infrastructure to manage and disseminate its wealth of open data. To achieve this, the EITI team partnered with the [Civic Literacy Initiative](https://civicliteraci.es/)—an organization dedicated to making civic data more accessible—and the PortalJS Cloud team to build a powerful, fully customizable open data portal.

### A Partnership for Transparency

The collaboration brought together three key actors:

1. [EITI](https://eiti.org/): The organization demanding a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use platform to share extractive industry data with stakeholders worldwide.

2. [Civic Literacy Initiative](https://civicliteraci.es/): The driving force behind connecting communities with essential civic data, ensuring that crucial information is delivered in a way that empowers public understanding and civic engagement.

3. [PortalJS Cloud Team](https://portaljs.com): Technology and solutions experts who specialize in creating open data portals, offering deep customization, seamless integration, and a developer-friendly environment.

### The Open Data Portal

The result of this collaboration is the official EITI open data portal, accessible at [https://eiti.portaljs.com](https://eiti.portaljs.com). The portal is a centralized hub where users—from policymakers and journalists to researchers and concerned citizens—can easily find, analyze, and share vital information about extractive industries. Built on the PortalJS Cloud platform, the solution is designed from the ground up to be:

- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive navigation and responsive design make discovering data straightforward and accessible.

- **Data-Rich**: A comprehensive repository of EITI’s open datasets, enabling users to explore country-level reports, production figures, revenue distributions, and more.

- **Scalable & Secure**: Robust infrastructure that can easily handle growth in data volumes and user traffic, ensuring consistent performance and data integrity.

### Complete Customization & Control

One of EITI’s core requirements was the ability to tailor the user experience to its unique audience and mission. The PortalJS Cloud team responded by granting full access to the portal’s underlying templates and source code. By providing a public GitHub repository of the default PortalJS template, the Civic Literacy Initiative and EITI teams could:

- **Design a Distinct Look and Feel**: Modify everything from color schemes and layouts to iconography, ensuring the portal’s brand and visual language reflect EITI’s identity.

- **Enhance the User Experience**: Adjust navigation flows, implement custom search filters, and integrate advanced data visualization tools to better guide stakeholders in understanding complex datasets.

- **Iterate Continuously**: With direct access to the codebase, the teams can respond swiftly to user feedback, roll out new features, and refine the interface—ensuring that the platform evolves alongside the community it serves.

### The Impact

By harnessing PortalJS Cloud’s flexible platform, EITI and the Civic Literacy Initiative can now share information seamlessly, foster global trust in extractive reporting, and strengthen the foundations of civic literacy. The fully customizable portal ensures that as the needs of EITI’s audience grow and shift, the platform can evolve in tandem, always providing up-to-date and relevant resources for anyone seeking greater transparency in extractive industries.

### Looking Ahead

EITI’s open data portal stands as a testament to the power of collaboration and the importance of user empowerment in digital solutions. As EITI continues to refine and expand its data offerings, the groundwork laid by the Civic Literacy Initiative and PortalJS Cloud team ensures that the portal will remain at the forefront of open data innovation—supporting informed decision-making, encouraging public engagement, and advancing the principles of global transparency for years to come.

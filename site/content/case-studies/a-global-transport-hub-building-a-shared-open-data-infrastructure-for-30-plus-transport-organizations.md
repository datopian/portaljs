title: A Global Transport Hub - Building a shared, open data infrastructure for 30+ transport organizations
metatitle: Transport Data Commons Open Data Portal Built with PortalJS and CKAN
metaDescription: See how Transport Data Commons used PortalJS and CKAN to launch a global open data portal—automating ingestion, standardizing SDMX metadata, and improving data access.
description: We helped the Transport Data Commons (TDC) transform fragmented transport and sustainability data into a unified, public-facing portal. Using CKAN and PortalJS, we built a user-friendly platform that standardizes metadata, automates data ingestion, and enables seamless access and collaboration across 30+ global organizations.

keystats:
  [
    '30+ organizations/n sharing one shared portal',
    '100% custom frontend/n built entirely with PortalJS',
    '80% less manual work/n through automation and workflows',
  ]
faqs:
  - question: 'Is PortalJS only for CKAN?'
    answer: 'No — PortalJS is backend-agnostic. It works equally well with CKAN, OpenMetadata, or custom APIs.'
  - question: 'Do I need a developer to manage the portal?'
    answer: 'Not for everyday content. Editors can manage FAQs, About pages, and more via GitHub or your preferred CMS.'
  - question: 'How long does a PortalJS portal take to launch?'
    answer: 'Most deployments go live in 1–2 weeks, depending on the features needed.'
  - question: 'Can we manage our own hosting later?'
    answer: 'Yes. Many clients start with Datopian-hosted and then move to internal infrastructure. We help with migration.'
  - question: 'What makes this better than just CKAN?'
    answer: 'CKAN is great for metadata and APIs. PortalJS adds the human layer — modern search, visualizations, dashboards, and guided user experiences.'
problem:
  'Transport and sustainability data was scattered across disconnected systems—PDFs, spreadsheets, and portals with limited structure. There was no unified place to find consistent, high-quality datasets. Without shared metadata standards or clear contribution processes, organizations struggled to collaborate, often duplicating work. Analysts spent more time cleaning data than analyzing it.'
solution:
  'Datopian delivered a unified open data platform using CKAN for the backend and PortalJS for the frontend. We replaced the default UI with a custom, fully decoupled interface tailored to non-technical users. The platform includes automated data ingestion pipelines, SDMX-compliant metadata, rich search and filter tools, onboarding flows, and role-based publishing workflows—making data management and access faster, simpler, and more reliable.'
results:
  'TDC now operates a centralized, public data portal where 30+ organizations can contribute, manage, and explore datasets efficiently. The platform enables faster decision-making, reduces duplication, and supports international collaboration. Contributors follow structured publishing flows; users benefit from intuitive discovery tools. By standardizing data and simplifying workflows, the portal turns fragmented inputs into a shared, trusted resource.'
